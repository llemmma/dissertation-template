# UC Davis Dissertation Template

A LaTeX dissertation template for UC Davis PhD students, built on the `memoir` document class with a dual-compilation architecture: each chapter compiles both as part of the full dissertation and as a standalone article.

Developed by Brandon Hopkins (Philosophy, UC Davis).


## Getting Started

The template requires a TeX distribution with `pdflatex` and `biber` (e.g., TeX Live, MacTeX, MiKTeX).

As shipped, the template uses the [`french-logic`](https://github.com/bphopkins/configs/blob/main/latex/french-logic/french-logic.sty) package, which bundles the structural packages the template needs (`biblatex` with biber, `hyperref`, `setspace`) together with theorem environments, notation macros, and other content-level features used by the example chapters.  You can keep this dependency or replace it --- see the two paths below.

### With `french-logic` (default)

The `.gitignore` excludes `.sty` files, so `french-logic.sty` must be made available separately:

- **Symlink** into the project directory: `ln -s /path/to/french-logic.sty .`
- **Install** in your local texmf tree: copy to `~/texmf/tex/latex/french-logic/french-logic.sty` and run `texhash ~/texmf`

Either way, changes to the `.sty` file take effect on the next compilation with no reinstall needed.

Then build:

```bash
pdflatex dissertation.tex && biber dissertation && pdflatex dissertation.tex && pdflatex dissertation.tex
```

### Without `french-logic`

The template's dual-compilation architecture does not depend on `french-logic`.  The only packages the template structure requires are `biblatex` (with biber backend), `hyperref`, and `setspace`.  Everything else `french-logic` provides --- theorem environments, modal and deontic notation, custom list environments, and so on --- is used only by the example chapter content.

To remove the dependency:

1. In `dissertation.tex` and each article wrapper (`*/article/*-article.tex`), replace:
   ```latex
   \usepackage{french-logic}
   ```
   with:
   ```latex
   \usepackage[backend=biber]{biblatex}
   \usepackage{hyperref}
   \usepackage{setspace}
   ```

2. Add any packages your own content requires (e.g., `amsthm` for theorem environments, `amsmath` for mathematics, `enumitem` for custom lists).

3. Replace the example chapter content and bibliography entries with your own.

Everything else --- the `memoir` class setup, the `\input` structure, the bibliography pipeline (`\addbibresource`, `\printbibliography`, the `\AtEveryBibitem` block), and the triple-pass build command --- works identically without `french-logic`.

## Architecture

### Dual-Compilation Model

Each chapter lives in its own directory as a single `.tex` file containing **only content** --- no `\documentclass`, no `\begin{document}`, no preamble.  This file is `\input`ed in two contexts:

1. **Full dissertation:** `dissertation.tex` wraps it in a `\chapter{...}` heading under the `memoir` class.
2. **Standalone article:** A wrapper in the chapter's `article/` subdirectory provides its own `\documentclass{article}` preamble and wraps the content in a `\section{Introduction}` heading.

You write your chapter content once and get both outputs.

### TEX Root Directives

Each chapter file begins with a magic comment:

```latex
% !TEX root = ./article/chapter1-article.tex
```

This tells your editor (TeXShop, VS Code LaTeX Workshop, Emacs AUCTeX, etc.) to compile the standalone article version when you build from within the chapter file.  Frontmatter files point to `../dissertation.tex` instead.

### Section Levels

Because the chapter content sits under `\chapter{...}` in the dissertation and under `\section{Introduction}` in the article, use **`\section`** as the top-level heading in chapter files.  Introductory prose before the first `\section` will fall under the article wrapper's `\section{Introduction}`.

In the dissertation, the hierarchy is:

    \chapter  →  \section  →  \subsection  →  \subsubsection

In the article, it is:

    \section{Introduction}  →  \section{...}  →  \subsection{...}

Both give clean, natural numbering.

### Bibliography

A single `refs.bib` at the project root is shared by all documents:

- `dissertation.tex` references it as `refs.bib`
- Article wrappers reference it as `../../refs.bib` (two levels up from `chapter/article/`)

The bibliography backend is **biber** (not BibTeX).  The `\AtEveryBibitem` block in each preamble suppresses DOI, language, and ISBN fields, and suppresses URLs for non-online entries.

The dissertation uses `\nocite{*}` to print **all** bibliography entries.  Article wrappers print only cited entries.

### Memoir Features

The template uses `memoir`-specific commands:

- `\frontmatter` / `\mainmatter` / `\backmatter` for page numbering and chapter numbering
- `\titlingpage` for the title page
- `\DoubleSpacing` for the main body
- `\tableofcontents*` (starred = unnumbered heading)
- `\setsecnumdepth{subsubsection}` and `\settocdepth{subsection}` for numbering/TOC control


## Build Commands

All builds use the triple-pass pattern: `pdflatex` → `biber` → `pdflatex` → `pdflatex`.

**Full dissertation** (from the project root):

```bash
pdflatex dissertation.tex && biber dissertation && pdflatex dissertation.tex && pdflatex dissertation.tex
```

**Standalone chapter article** (from the chapter's `article/` directory):

```bash
cd chapter1/article
pdflatex chapter1-article.tex && biber chapter1-article && pdflatex chapter1-article.tex && pdflatex chapter1-article.tex
```

### Why three passes?

1. First `pdflatex`: reads the source, generates `.aux` and `.bcf` files, but cross-references and citations are unresolved.
2. `biber`: reads `.bcf`, processes `refs.bib`, outputs `.bbl`.
3. Second `pdflatex`: incorporates the `.bbl`, resolves most references.
4. Third `pdflatex`: resolves any remaining forward references and page numbers.


## Customization

### Changing title, author, department, and committee

Edit three places:

1. **`dissertation.tex`** --- the `\title{...}` and `\author{...}` commands, and the copyright page.
2. **`frontmatter/title-page.tex`** --- the title, author name, department, committee member names, and year.
3. **Each article wrapper** --- the `\title{...}` and `\author{...}` commands.

### Adding a new chapter

1. Create the directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p chapter4/article
   ```

2. Create `chapter4/chapter4.tex` with the TEX root directive:
   ```latex
   % !TEX root = ./article/chapter4-article.tex

   Introductory prose for this chapter...

   \section{First Section}
   ...
   ```

3. Copy any existing article wrapper to `chapter4/article/chapter4-article.tex` and update the `\title`, the `\input` path (to `../chapter4.tex`), and the `\addbibresource` path (should be `../../refs.bib`).

4. Add to `dissertation.tex` before `\backmatter`:
   ```latex
   \chapter{Fourth Chapter Title}\label{ch:chapter4}
   \input{./chapter4/chapter4.tex}
   ```

### Removing a chapter

Comment out or delete the `\chapter{...}` and `\input{...}` lines in `dissertation.tex`.  Optionally remove the directory.

### Removing the dedication or copyright page

These are clearly marked blocks in `dissertation.tex`.  Delete or comment them out.

### Adding appendices

`memoir` supports appendices via `\appendix` before `\backmatter`:

```latex
\appendix
\chapter{Proofs of Technical Lemmas}\label{app:proofs}
\input{./appendices/proofs.tex}

\backmatter
```

### Changing the article wrapper pattern

The default article wrapper includes a table of contents and wraps chapter content in `\section{Introduction}`.  For simpler chapters that don't need a TOC, you can strip the wrapper down to:

```latex
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\doublespacing
\input{../chapter.tex}
\printbibliography
\end{document}
```
